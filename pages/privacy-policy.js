        <p className="my-4">
          Vijona Africa is committed to protecting our donors’ privacy. Our
          donors expect that we will use their support wisely. They also place
          their trust in us concerning the personal information that they may
          share with their gifts. We value our donors’ trust and we recognize
          that maintaining this trust requires us to be transparent and
          accountable to our supporters and the public. An organization that
          deals with individuals and information about individuals in its daily
          operations and fundraising activities must secure that information.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          We maintain all records of donations to Vijona Africa according to the
          applicable standards for record retention in effect at the time of the
          donation. All records are maintained in a secure location.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          Vijona Africa uses the information it collects for its own purposes.
          We do not share or sell donor&#39;s information, except we may share
          information with partners to perform work on our behalf. Our partners
          do not share or sell any information received from us and only use
          this information to provide their services. This applies to all donor
          information, received online and offline.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          We will not send mailings to our donors on behalf of other
          organizations. In exceptional circumstances, we may be required to
          disclose information due to a legal requirement, for grant
          applications and to prevent unauthorized bank credit or debit card
          transactions.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          Vijona Africa does on occasion acknowledge donors by name and/or
          description of donation, after the donors have given permission for
          such use. From time to time, it may be necessary for Vijona Africa to
          change its privacy policy.

        <p className="my-4">
          Except as expressly provided in another contract between you and us,
          your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with the website or Services is
          to terminate your account. Neither us nor any of our subsidiaries,
          affiliated companies or the owners, members, directors, officers,
          employees, contractors or agents of any of the same (“Affiliates”)

          any platform applications or any of the content or other materials on,
          accessed through or downloaded through the Services. This limitation
          of liability shall apply regardless of whether you base your claim on
          contract, tort, statute or any other legal theory; we knew or should
          have known about the possibility of such damages; or the limited
          remedies provided in this section fail of their essential purpose.

          including without limitation, your submission of content that violates

          binding arbitration rather than in court (arbitration does not involve
          a judge or jury and court review of arbitration awards is limited). If
          you have a claim, you should send a letter requesting arbitration and
          describing your claim to our registered agent in Missouri.

          The rules of the American Arbitration Association shall apply to the
          arbitration, but we are not required to use such association to
          conduct the actual arbitration. You agree that disputes and claims
          will be conducted and resolved on an individual basis and not in a
          class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a
